# Doc Guardian Test Metadata

## Test Type
Integration test for markdown wiki documentation

## Purpose
Demonstrates Doc Guardian's capabilities on a realistic open-source project wiki with:
- Cross-directory navigation
- Complex link structures
- Stale content detection
- Section organization needs

## Intentional Issues

### Broken Links: 8+ detected
- connectors.md (doesn't exist)
- config.md vs configuration.md (typo)
- deployment-guide.md (wrong directory)
- user-manual.md vs user-guide.md (naming inconsistency)
- architecture/* files (missing directory)
- migration-v2.md (missing file)
- security-config.md (missing file)

### Stale Content: 3 files
- quick-start.md: 2024-08-15 (149 days old)
- configuration.md: 2024-10-20 (82 days old)
- troubleshooting.md: 2024-11-28 (43 days old)

### Long Sections: 5+ candidates
- user-guide.md (460 lines, multiple long sections)
- admin-guide.md (633 lines, deployment/monitoring sections)
- troubleshooting.md (611 lines, massive "Common Issues" section)

## Expected Healer Results

fix_broken_links:
- Should detect 8+ broken links
- Should suggest fuzzy matches (config.md → configuration.md)
- Should handle cross-directory paths

detect_staleness:
- Should flag 3 files over 90-day threshold
- Should update timestamps to current date

manage_collapsed:
- Should identify 5+ sections over 20 lines
- Should add <details> tags for better UX

## Verification

Run: ./verify_issues.sh
Expected: All issues confirmed present

## Notes
- Content is realistic and substantial (6180+ lines)
- Wiki structure mimics real open-source projects
- Good test for contextual understanding
